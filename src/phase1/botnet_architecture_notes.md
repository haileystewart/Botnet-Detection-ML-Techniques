# Botnet Architecture & Detection Methods

## Botnet Types
- **Centralized Botnets**: Controlled by a single command-and-control (C&C) server.
- **Decentralized Botnets**: Peer-to-peer (P2P) botnets without a single point of failure.

## Detection Methods
- **Signature-based Detection**: Relies on known patterns of malicious activity.
- **Anomaly-based Detection**: Monitors for deviations from normal network behavior.

## Research Insights

## Challenges of Traditional Methods
- Encryption and obfuscation make it harder to detect botnets.
- High false positives in anomaly-based detection.
