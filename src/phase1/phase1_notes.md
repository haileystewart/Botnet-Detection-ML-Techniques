# Phase 1: Key Findings and Results

In **Phase 1**, we focused on understanding the architecture of botnets and implementing a basic simulation of botnet communication using **Scapy**. The simulation centered around a **centralized botnet model**, where multiple bots (`192.168.1.10`, `192.168.1.11`, `192.168.1.12`) communicated with a single **Command & Control (C2) server** (`192.168.1.100`) using **TCP on port 80**.

### The core functionality of this phase was to:

- **Simulate botnet traffic**: Each bot sent one of three predefined commands—`DDoS attack`, `Steal data`, or `Download malware`—to the C2 server.
- **Capture and analyze the traffic**: Using **Wireshark**, we captured the packets transmitted between the bots and the C2 server, identifying key traffic patterns and confirming that the bot commands were being successfully transmitted.
- **Document the findings**: The network traffic was captured and documented in Wireshark for further analysis.

## Findings from Phase 1

### Centralized Botnet Architecture:
- The code implemented a **centralized botnet** where all bots communicated directly with the C2 server.
- Each bot was assigned a specific task (`DDoS attack`, `data theft`, or `malware download`), and the commands were sent as **TCP packets** to the server.
- While this centralized architecture is easier to control, it also introduces a **single point of failure**—if the C2 server is detected and shut down, the entire botnet becomes ineffective.

### C&C Communication:
- The communication between the bots and the C2 server followed a predictable **C&C pattern**, where the bots sent periodic commands, and the C2 server acknowledged them.
- The use of **TCP** ensured reliable command delivery, making the detection of these patterns easier via traditional **signature-based** or **anomaly-based** detection methods.
- The traffic patterns observed (sequence of **SYN, ACK, and command payloads**) can be used to detect similar botnet traffic in real-world networks.

### Detection Methods:
1. **Signature-based detection**: This method could effectively detect the botnet traffic in our simulation because the commands were sent as plaintext over TCP, making them easy to identify with known signatures.
2. **Anomaly-based detection**: The traffic generated by our simulation is periodic and predictable, making it easier to detect through traffic analysis if anomalous patterns (e.g., high traffic spikes or unusual connection requests) are monitored.

## Deliverables from Phase 1:

- **botnet_architecture_study.py**: A Python script using Scapy to simulate botnet traffic and C&C communication.
- **Wireshark Analysis**: We captured and analyzed the network traffic in Wireshark, documenting the results in `/src/Phase1/wireshark_analysis.md`.
- **Botnet Architecture Documentation**: The architecture of centralized botnets, along with our findings, has been documented in this file (`/docs/botnet_architecture_notes.md`).
