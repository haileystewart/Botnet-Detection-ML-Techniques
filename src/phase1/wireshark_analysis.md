# Wireshark Traffic Analysis

## Botnet Traffic Capture
- Set up Wireshark to capture network traffic from a botnet simulation.
- Captured traffic includes [details on packets, protocols, etc.]

## Traffic Patterns Observed
- **C&C Communication**: Detected frequent connections to a specific IP, mimicking botnet behavior.
- **Unusual Traffic Volume**: Large amounts of traffic were generated in short bursts, indicating a possible DDoS attack.

## Next Steps
- Implement rule-based detection to identify these traffic patterns in real-time.
